 * MORPHING RINGS — a tilted concentric-ring particle disc.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS: ~40k–80k particles arranged in concentric annular bands, viewed
 * from a low-angle perspective camera tilted ~30–40° above the disc plane. The
 * inner void is not a static circle — it is driven by a live SDF that morphs
 * continuously through: circle → pentagon → rounded polygon → heart → circle.
 * The morph is just a smooth interpolation between three analytic 2D SDFs,
 * evaluated per-vertex in the vertex shader against each particle's stored (r, θ).
 *
 * PARTICLE PLACEMENT: Particles are distributed across N concentric ring bands.
 * Within each band the radius is perturbed by a stored gaussian offset so the
 * band has a soft, dusty edge rather than a hard ring. Angle is random within
 * [0, TAU]. Both are baked into the GPU buffer at init and never change — the
 * motion comes entirely from per-frame uniforms.
 *
 * INNER VOID: Each particle has its stored (r, θ) checked against the morphing
 * SDF boundary in the vertex shader. Particles inside the void fade out (alpha →
 * 0); particles at the edge get a cyan brightness boost — that is the inner ring
 * glow. The SDF is 2D in the disc plane; the tilt is purely the camera.
 *
 * MORPHING SDF: Three shapes, linearly interpolated by a periodic phase:
 *   - Circle:   d = r
 *   - Pentagon: d = r / cos(mod(atan(y,x), TAU/5) - TAU/10)
 *   - Heart:    analytic polynomial SDF (Inigo Quilez formulation)
 * The phase cycles 0→1 every `morphPeriod` seconds. The three shapes are visited
 * as: circle (t=0), pentagon (t=0.25→0.75), heart (t=0.5→0.75), back to circle.
 *
 * ROTATION: The disc auto-rotates around its Y axis. No drag in the reference —
 * the camera is purely cinematic, framed by a static Tilt X (pitch) / Tilt Y
 * (roll) pair.
 *
 * ONE DRAW CALL: the disc is everything the component paints. The background is
 * the root's CSS colour — there is no starfield (it was removed) and no GL clear
 * colour, so the canvas stays transparent over it.
 *
 * Rule 6 recipe: ONE GL context built in useEffect([]); every live input read
 * from a ref inside a raw rAF loop. Never calls loseContext().

/* 15 leaf dials, hybrid layout, shared ranges.
 *
 * The colours and the camera used to be buried in groups while Density and
 * Dot Size sat loose; the headline set is now uniformly at the top level.
 *
 * Changed keys, clean break, no fallbacks:
 *   colour.*              -> top level
 *   camera.cameraDistance -> distance   (top level)
 *   motion.rotSpeed       -> speed      (top level, signed -100..100)
 *   ring.bandWidth        -> ring.width
 *   wave.waveAmplitude    -> wave.amplitude  (prefix dropped)
 *
 * Cut and frozen at the shipped value: `motion.morphSpeed` and
 * `wave.waveSpeed` (two more rates beside the headline Speed — one Speed dial
 * is the contract), and `interaction.cursorRadius`, a single-dial group tuning
 * a gesture that still works exactly as it shipped.
 *
 * SCALE CHANGE — not migratable: `speed` was the raw rotation rate (0..60,
 * shipped 7); it is now the signed dial where 50 is that shipped rate.
 *
 * SECOND PASS, clean break, no fallbacks:
 *   baseColor + accentColor + accentMix -> colors[]   (max 5;
 *       every particle takes one entry by its stored random, and the LAST entry
 *       is the highlight the void edge and the wave crests pull toward — the job
 *       accentColor used to hold)
 *   wave.amplitude                      -> amplitude  (top level; the Waves
 *       group held one dial, so the group is gone)
 *   camera.tilt                         -> camera.tiltX
 *   ROLL_START (frozen)                 -> camera.tiltY  (camera roll, the
 *       lean left/right; it was frozen at -5 and is now a dial again)
 *
 * Cut and frozen at its current default (the panel row goes, the
 * render path is unchanged): `innerVoid`. The void itself still exists and
 * still morphs — it IS the component — only its radius dial is gone, pinned at
 * the 28% it shipped at.
 *
 * `glow` was cut the same way but is now DELETED, not frozen (see SIXTH PASS).
 *
 * THIRD PASS, clean break, no fallbacks:
 *   speed          -> 0..100 unsigned; the sign moved to a new `direction` enum
 *                     (cw / ccw). Not migratable: a stored -30 now reads as -30
 *                     against a 0 floor and clamps to 0.
 *   distance       -> scale   (bare 0..100, 50 = the shipped framing, same
 *                     reading as Speed). A pullback dial titled "Scale" would run
 *                     backwards, so the number is inverted internally:
 *                     dist = BASE_DISTANCE / (scale / 50). Higher = bigger.
 *                     Not migratable — the stored number means the opposite.
 *   camera.tiltX   -> tilt.x
 *   camera.tiltY   -> tilt.y
 *   density        -> max 150 -> 200 (range widened only; values keep meaning).
 *
 * FOURTH PASS: the background starfield is gone — shaders, program, static
 * buffers and its draw call, all removed. It was never a control; the disc is
 * now the only thing the component draws, over the CSS `Background`.
 *
 * FIFTH PASS — hover, rates, and the 0..100 reading. Clean break, no fallbacks.
 *
 *   HOVER. The cursor-vanish disc is gone: its uniforms (`uCursor`, `uCurR`),
 *   the shader's vanish term, the screen->disc `planeHit` ray-cast and the
 *   `cursorRadius` constant, all removed. Hover now BOOSTS: a `Hover Speed`
 *   percent multiplying every rate at once (spin, morph, wave), eased in and
 *   out by the same `Transition` control that used to open the vanish disc.
 *   The listeners moved from `pointermove` to `pointerenter`, which fires once
 *   per crossing instead of re-arming the gate on every move event, and the
 *   host is no longer measured (rule G — no getBoundingClientRect).
 *
 *   FIXED — Direction rendered backwards. `+uSpin` sends the NEAR edge of the
 *   disc (bottom of frame, pz < 0) to the RIGHT, which is counter-clockwise as
 *   seen from the camera; the enum mapped `cw` to +1. The sign is flipped.
 *
 *   FIXED — Speed barely turned the disc. The rate ran through
 *   `(rotSpeed / 100) * TAU * 0.05`, so Speed 50 was 0.022 rad/s: one lap every
 *   285 seconds. It is now radians/sec derived from `ROT_DEG_AT_50 = 10`, one
 *   lap every 36s at Speed 50.
 *
 *   FIXED — the morph never visibly happened. `morphSpeed 14` through
 *   `(x / 100) * 0.04` was one circle->pentagon->heart cycle every 178 seconds.
 *   It is a period now: `MORPH_PERIOD = 30` seconds.
 *
 *   SCALE CHANGES, none migratable — the stored number is the same either way:
 *     density        -> 1..100, x240 particles per unit. 100 is what the old
 *                       0..200 dial produced at 300.
 *     dotSize        -> max 12 -> 10.
 *     amplitude      -> 0..100 at 4 world units each, so 100 is the old dial's
 *                       400 ceiling. The shipped 55 lands at 14. This one does
 *                       NOT follow the panel's "50 is how it shipped" reading.
 *     ring.width     -> 0..100 where 50 is the shipped 120 world units.
 *     ring.softness  -> 0..100 where 50 is the shipped fuzz/glow (was 0..300
 *                       with 100 as the shipped value).
 *
 * SIXTH PASS — the frozen glow is deleted. Both CSS layers under the canvas are
 * gone: the teal centre haze (`rgba(22,120,100,0.18)` at 55%x45%, 50%/58%) and
 * the 70%-black edge vignette. `Background` is now painted flat, so the colour
 * picked in the panel is the colour that renders. This is a visual change to
 * every live instance by design — it is what the frozen tint was doing.
 * Nothing else moved: `ring.softness` still drives the shader's own EDGE glow
 * on the disc, which is geometry, not a page-level wash.
